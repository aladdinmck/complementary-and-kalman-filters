# complementary-and-kalman-filters
The following is a magnetometer and accelerometer setup with an Arduino Uno used to achieve more accurate readings. More accurate readings were achieved in two ways. One using complementary filters and the other using a Kalman filter. 


##TODO
* Find ptich and roll from Accelerometer
* Find pitch roll and yaw from gyroscope
* Find yaw from magentometer
* Use all three measurement in a complementary filter
* Plot them in Arduino Serial Plotter
